alvu OF SALLUST. xxiii

lust’s two extant vorke plainly show what his uotion of

historical composition was: the style was for him the

first thing. It 10 very probable that a rich man, who did

not love patient research‚ would employ some poor man

“ of letters to do the hard work of getting the 1001010-
gether, and such labour is done in our days. If we could
only have all the facts laid before us without any trouble,
we might all write history, and it would be a pleasant
occupatiori enough, and not very laborious. But some
would do it better than others, and there are men who
would do it very badly even with this help.

Sallust got a great reputation among the Romans as

'carefully registoring the events of each year, but not
making a contiuuous narrative which should please and

However, if they did their work well, they were very

Sallust, did not affect 10 write history. Hc only wrote
commentarii or Memoirs, out of which ahistory might
have been made; but most fortunately nobody has
done it.

Sallust then appears as the earliest Roman historiam
in the sense in which history was then understood, and
