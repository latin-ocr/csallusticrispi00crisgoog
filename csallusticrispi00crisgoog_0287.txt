THE CAPTURE OF cmm.

(rua. a. aa.)

Kurra places the capture oi cirta in Μ. 116 (chronological Tabia,
p· 99). 116 gives no reasons for {iring this date. 1 suppose that he
deduces the time from Sallust's narrative, but it is impossible to de-

commissionem. ibus he places more than four years between Ad·
herbal's restoration and his death at the capture oi cirta. Part of this
