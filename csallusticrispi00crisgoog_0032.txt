ΗΒΕ OF SALLUST. xnv

by hundreda. The translations are very numerous,
Spanish, French, English, Dutch, German, Danish,
Italian, and probably others. The Italian, when it is·
well handled‚ is the best language for translating Latin.
The latest Italian translation that I know is by Vittorio
Allieri. He mistakes the meaning of Sallust sometimes,
hut he has well rendered the original in his close and
vigorous style.

Of Lives of Sallust too there are plenty. I have used·
and referred to that by Kritz, which is prefixed to his
edition of Sallust. There isa long tedicus life of Sallust
in French by the Presidcnt de Bvosses, a man of learn-

and I have got something good from all of them, as the
references in the notes will show. 1 have no doubt that
other editions also contain good things, which I have
missod for want of looking after them; but if a man uses ’
every great number of books, it is likely that his work
will not be the better for it. Every edition may contain
something good which is not in another edition. But if
aman has any thing of his own to offer, he had better be
content with a few good books to help him end trust to
himself for the rest, ov not undertake the work at all.

Ido not see how the history of the Jugurthine war
can he made clear to young studente. Certainly Sallust’s
narrative is very far from being clear. If a teacher could
give to his pupils some exact notions of the kind of
country in which this war was carried on, that would

help a little. There are many books on Algeria, written

vince the French occupation, and some on {usim but
