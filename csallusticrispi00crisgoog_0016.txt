LIFE 01⁴* SALLUST. ir ··

them3 the fair conclusion from which is, that Sallust’s
ejeetion was a party proeeeding, whatever truth there
may have been in tha charge of his livinga seandalous
life.

The unknown author of the miserable Declamation
against Sallust hints that Sallust after his ejection went
to Caesar. In the early part of ao. 50, Caesar was in
North Italy; he spent the summer of that year in Trans·
alpine Gallia, and returned to North Italy again at the

something to that effect, in a very confused way.

In aa. 47 Sallust was praetor designatus, and thais he
would be restored to his rank in the Senate, though it is·
likely enough that he was restored before by Caesar, but

mutinous and refused to go into Africa, claiming the ful·
filment of the promises whioh Caesar had made them aft ter
the battle of Pharsalia, and release from service. Caesar
sant Sallust to the mutineers, into Campania, as Dion
Cassius says, but the praetor's eloquenoe did not pacify:
