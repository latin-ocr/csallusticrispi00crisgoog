Han OF SALLUST. 'xxi

do'es not show any exact acquaintance with the country.
Asa military history it is of no valae. His chronology
inconfused3 his description of the military operations is·
sometimes unintelligible; he often omits the names of
places, when the names would be the only means of
making the story clear. He does not tell us which way
the armies are moving, and gives us no notion of dis·
tances, and generally a very vague description of the
ground. If his materiale furnished him with exact in·
formation, he used thern very carelessly or very badly.
He had no talant at all for writing the history of a war.
As we have however no other history of this war, his
work is valuahle, and if we overlook its defecta as a mili·

arapid and lively way the career of the bold Numidian
adventurer from the time of his service under Scipio in
Spain to his capture by a Roman more cunning and more
treacherons than himself.

Sallust also wrote Historiae, and he wrote them after
he wrote the Jugurthine war (Jug. c. 95). It is oon-
cluded from the extant fragments that the histories com-

the end of rao. 67. Some critice think that the passage
in Ausonius (Id. iv.) shows that Sallust’s Histories began
with rae. 90, the date of the Marsic war. Whether he
wrote a regular history of the period from no. 90
to Iac. '78 or not, it is very probable that he wrote
some sketch or outline of this period as an introduc·
tion to the history of the twelve yearsfrom rae. ¹78 to
the end of rac. 67. The fragments of Sallustius¹ His·
tories are arranged in five books and contained what
follows (Kritz). The First hook contained the disturb-
anee which Lepidus caused after Sulla‘s death, the vvar
with Sertorius in Spain till the arrival of On. Pompeius,
