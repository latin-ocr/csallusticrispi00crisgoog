rii · PREFAOE. ’

raised a man at Rome. Several of the later Roman

· writers give him abad character, and affirm that his

preacbing and his practice did not agree. It is conjec-
tured, and with much probability, that the writings of
Pompeius Laenas were the foundation of this bad name, “
in partat least. Laenas was a freedman os Pompeius
Magnus, and accompanied him in most of bis expeditione.
' After the death of Magnus and his sons, Laenas kept a
school in the Carinae, near the temple of Tellus. His
affection to his old master, says Suetonius, made him
write invectivas against Sallust, for Sallust had written in

band had not been distinguished personages. It is said,
- and the learned M. Varro is the authority for it, that
Milo caught Sallust in his adultery, gave him a good cow-

was a very proper punishment3 and the money may be
viewed as damages‚ such as incur system a husband may
get by legal proceedings against the adulterer. Milo
took the short and Roman way of getting payment for
the wrong, and Milo was in debt and wanted money.

Α Kritz admits that Varro was an honest man; but as he
was not only a learned man but also aPompeian, be thinks
it is not incredible that be could not refrain from inflicting
this stigma on a man of the opposite fection and a man
