the man, and he was compelled to fly for his life. Not·
“ withstanding Sallust's want of success in this mirsion,
Caesar commissioned him to take over some of the
legions into Sicily for the African war, as some writers
infer from aletter of Cicero to Atticus; but the letter
certainly does not prove that Sallust did take the legions
to Sicily. However‚ Sallust was in the African war, and
Caesar sent him with some ships to the island Cercina,
now the Karlrenna islanda off the coast of Tunis, to seiza
the stores of corn there. ‘The quaestorius 0. Decimius,
who was placed in Cercina to take care of the corn, fled
in a small vessel. Sallust was received by the islanders‚
and sent off alarge quantity of oorn to an'sar'a camp.
When the African war was ended by the defeat of J uha
and Scipio early in nc. 46, Caesar made J uha’s kingdom
of Numidia into a Roman province and left Sallust as
governor with the title of Proconsul. Sallust remained
in Africa during the year no. 46. In no. 45 he returned
toRomearich man.

Sallust spent the rest of his life in retirement. He
built a magnificent housia and made a beautiful garden at
Rome, in the valley which separates the Quirinal from
the Pincius or Collis Hortulorum. This part of Rome
¹ was ‚beyond the wall of Servius, and extended to the
Porta Salaria, which was on the north-east side of Rome.
The old Roman topographers affirm that the spot was
named Salustricum or Salustium to their day. N ear the
elevation on which the Ohurch of Sta Susanna stands
was the Forum Sallustii. The Horti Sallustiani after·
wards became imperial property, and were occupied by
Nero, Vespasian‚ and Aurelian. 'Phe Emperor Nerva
died here. Many valuable works of art have been found
hy excavating within the limits of Sallust's estate, and
some of them may have belonged to the historian.
