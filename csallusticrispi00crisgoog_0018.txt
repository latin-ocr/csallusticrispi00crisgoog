Han OF SALLUST. xi

Tbere is a story in Hieronymus that Sallust married
Terentia, the divorced wife of M. Cicero. Terentia was
put away by her husband in nc. 46. She was then fifty
at least, and Sallust was forty. Kritz says that it was so
unequal a match that we can scaroe believe it, unless
Sallust had some peculiar reasons for marrying Terentia.
But he may have had such reasons satisfactory to himself,
if not to Kritz, and such marriages are not unknown in
our times. We do not know if Sallust had any wife,
unless it was Terentia, and he left no children, and so far
the story of his marriage is consistent, for Terentia was
past the usual age of child-bearing. But Terentia, it is
said by the same writer who is the authority for her mar·
riaga with Sallust, married Messala Corvinus after Sal·
lust's death. She reached the age of one hundred and
three, and so had time enough to hare three husbands or
even more. , Howerer, there is no authority for the
marriage with Sallust except that of Hieronymus, but
he must have found this story somewhere.

Nothing is known of Sallust's life after Gaesar’s death,
or how he managed to live quietly in those troublesome
times. He amusad himself with writing history, having
retired from publio life and having no taste, as he says,
for agriculture or field sports, of both of which he speaks
with contempt (Cat. o. d). He died in mc. 35, in his·
fifty·first·year‚ and four years before the battle of Aetium.
His property went to his sister’s grandson, whom he had
adopted. 'dhis youth bore the historian's name, and was
aman of some induence under Augustus and Tiberius.
He died 1.]1. 20.

rho little that we know of Sallust is almost 1 proof
that 110 never attained any distinction as a publio man,
that he was neither an orator nor a soldier, that he had
neither eloquenoe nor military talant, tho two arts which
