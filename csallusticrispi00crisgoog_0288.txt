preceded it, but thera is still 1011 a considerable time after the new
aettlementin a c. 117, during which time we must suppose that Ju-
gurtha kept quiem if we can suppose that such 0 man could be quiet.

Kritz places the death 01 Hiempsal in sac. 116, and in the same year
all the events from 110 death of Hiempsal to tbe capture of Cirta (Jug.
cc. til-26). He puts the movements 01 110 tribune Memmius (c. 27)
in sac. 112, about which there is nc dispute; but thus there isan in·
100001 01 three full years, and part 01 0 fourth, between 110 capture of
Cirta and the declaration of war against J ugurtha.

Sallust seems to mean (c. 21) that ¹Iugurtha formed his designa

against Adherbal as 0000 00 110 110000 commissionem left Africa3 and
if we look at his narrative, wa ara led to think that J ugurtha began to
executa his designa immediately. Events appear to go on with great
rapidity. Adherbalis defeated and shuts himself rrp in Cirta. He was
in the fifth mouth 01 110 siege when herent his letter to the Roman
Senata (c. 24); and the siege continued some 1100001100, 101 we cannot
tell how long. 1 doubt if all the events contained in cc. 20-26 would
happen within one year, and also the events contained in cc. la-la,
00 Kritz has supposed.
. Iam inclined to think that nc. 112 is tha date of tha capture 01
Cirta, which date agrees with 0111101 Sallust says in 0. 27. 11 1110 10
a right conclusion, Sallust in his rapld style, caring more for 0110011100
10010011, has made it appear as if Hiempsal's death, and the defeat of
Adherbal, and the siege of Cirta, all followed in qulcls succession. If
ha was pleased with the dramatic style in which 10 had managed this
part 01110 story, ba should not have written 0. 27 10 0001 0 way as 10
show that his previous story could not be true as 10 the matter of
11000.
