xiv PREFAOE.

rumour,whioh however was one of amuoh more positive na-
· ture than this which Asconius reports. Kritz also thinks
that a reconciliation between Milo and Sallust cannot be
believed, aster what had happened. Thetis a matter
which nobody can decide. Milo might easily forget his
Ι wrong, for he had been paid ferit, and his wife made the
< thing familiar to him; and if Sallust did not forget the
floggiug, he knew that he was not the only man in Rome

if he had preached less. His moral talk is of the kind
which we now call by the expressive term ‘canta‘

Sallust is one of the witnesses for it. But we can give
uo weight to the author of this miserable composition,
whoever he was. The Declamation was certainly written
not long after Sallust’s time, but it is a poor, feeble piece
of work, which no man of sense could have written; and

as we do not know who wrote it, we have nothing which
