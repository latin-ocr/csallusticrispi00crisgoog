LIFE OF anhausu. xix

ready to encourage any bold disturber of the peace and
share the profit with him. Itis no wonder that in such
astate of society, where, besides the dissolute rich who
were impoverished, there was also a large body of desti·
tute citizens in Rome, that an insolvent patrician should
attempt to do again what Sulla had done. Republican
states are most exposed to such designa when they have
become corrupted. Rome was a mixed oligarohul and
democratic constitution, but in Catilina's time the few
had the power, and yet Catilina found it impossible to
reach the highest honours of the state, for which it is
hard to find a sufficient reason, except that he was hated
and feared by the people and also by the nobility to which
he belonged. It was truly said by Hobbes that Thucydides
‘saith that among the few every one‘desireth to be chief,
aad they that are undervalued, boarit with less patience
than in a democracy, whereupon sedition followeth aad
dissolution of the government.¹ So Catilina aud his des·
perata associates attempted to overthrow the few. It was
a conspiracy of insolvents, neither the first nor the last
that history has recorded. It failed for want of capacity
in the conspirators‚ not for want of opportunity, for the
opportunity was great. Caesar did what Catilina wished
to d0, but he did it in a different way.

In a few brief chapters (Cat. 36-39), Sallust has well
described the wretched condition of the Roman State at
this time. It is one of the best parts· of his extant
writings, precise and foroibly written. He is not blama·
ble for not making a longer story of the conspiracy, but
he merita censure for his introduction, for some carelcss
passages, some inaccuracies‚ and some omissione. On the
other hand he has the merit of doing the thing short and
not wearying us as some modern historiens dc, who write
as ifa history were to be valued by its length.
