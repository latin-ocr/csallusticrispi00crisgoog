'Phe J ugurtha or Bellum J ugurthinum was selected by
Sallust as a subject of great variety and interest, and as
an epoch memorable 161 the commencement of that
attach on the power of the nobility which ended in the
civil ware, the devastation 61 Italy, and the establisbmant
of that imperial power which Sallust did not live to see,
though 116 must have seen that it was coming. He
would find materiale in the public recorda at Rome and
in various contemporary writers. Μ. Aemilius Scaurus,
to whom Sallust gives a bad character and Cicero a good
one, wrote three books of his memoirs. He could have>
told something about his own intrigues with J ugurtha, if
he chose. P. Rutilius Rufus, the legatus of Metellus in
Africa, wrote his memoirs 111 five books and also 'a Roman
history in Greek, 116111 which Plutarch quotes a passage
in which Rufus affirmed that Marius got his sixth con-
sulship by bribery. It is probable that this work and
Rufus' Memoirs contained some notice of the Jugur·
tbine war. The historiam Sisenna, whom Sallust man·
tione (J ug. c. 95), wrote the civil war of Sulla, and we

may assume that he said something 61 Sulla's early life
¹ 6111161 his services in the war against J ugurtha. There
were also the Memoirs of Sulla, who was working at
them two days before his death, and died when he was
611 the twenty-second book. All these men lived at the
time of the J ugurthine war and were 1161116111 public
affairs. Sallust's authority 161 some of the early history
'of Africa was tbe Panic books of King Hiempsal, which
somebody translated or explained to him. The chapter
of Orosius which is referred to in a note on J ug. c. 37,

proves that Orosius had other materiale 161 his short
sketch besides Sallust.
