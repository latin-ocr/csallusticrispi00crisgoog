xxiv , PREFACE.

in which it is generally conceived now. He has ex·
plained what he considered hiatorioal writing to bo, and
hohas left two speoimens of it. It is not the place here
to discum what history should be. People may give to a
word like History almost any meaning that they choose.
Hobbes, in his address to his readers prefixed to his
translation 01 Thucydides, has said very plainly and
¹clearly how he understands history. Sallust no doubt
imitated or supposed that he was imitating Greek
models; and hiatories such aa he has written are very
good things, when they are done well. But to do them
well, it is not enough to take facts at second hand. 'l‘he
labour 01 collecting the facts and weighing the evidence
is part 01 an historian’s work, and 11 he does it carefully,
he will ses what facts are material for the purpose which
he has in hand, what may be omitted as not material,
and how the facts must be ordered so that they stand in
their true relationto one another‚which includestheregard
to time; and by this careful examinatior and ordering of
the facts, he will make the instruction, which is the purpose
of history, flow from the facts themselves, and will thus
lay bare those hidden truths which are immersed in the
multitude of events, and will show what causes have
produced those effecta which in the annalist appear as
simple, unconneoted facts. Sallust did not do this
part 01 the labour 01 an historiar, and, if we allow him
the merit 01 style, eren more than he deserves, we cannot
assent to the absurd judgment 01 Velleius and Quin-
tilian, who compare him to Thucydides, to the best his·
torian that ever wrote.

The editions 01 Sallust are numerous. The first was
at 1101110, 1470, folio. Τ1101001 will never be, if we form

. a conjecture from the continual appearance 01 editions

¹from 1470 to the present time. une editions are counted
