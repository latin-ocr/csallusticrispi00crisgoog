LIFE OF SALLUST. xv

vouches for the evidence, and it should be rejected. Dion
Cassius, a writer who is often unworthy of credit, because
’ he was a lover ofscandal and has abad word for every body,
says that a prosecution was commenced against Sallust
for getting money unfairly in the province, but that his
friend Caesar let him off3 he adds that Sallust got into
very bad reputo for this affair, because his practice and
his writings were so much at variance. Dion thought
that Sallust wrote his historical worlrs before he was

been known. However, I set no value on Dion’s testi·
mony, and, as we say, we may give the historien the
benefit of the doubt in this case.

a man, evenis he lived before the deod, when the evi·

able nor 'nst to give a man a bad name, when we have

proved that he got money in Africa by dishonest means.
But if he did come back to Rome very rich after one
year's administration or somewhat more, he must have
made very good use of his time; and tho presumption is
certainly against him. 'lbere were many ways of getting
money in a country which had made a stout resistance to
