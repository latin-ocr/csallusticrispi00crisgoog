Han OF SALLUST. xiii

whom he did not like, following only vaguo city scandal.
This is the first time that I ever heard of aman's learn-
ing being a reason for his believing an idle rumour. The
conclusion ol Kritz involves the assumption that alearned
man has no sense and also no honesty. There could not
be more precise and positive testimony than that ol
Varro. Kritz says that this scandalous story could only
have been known from Sallust who was whipped and pald
the money, or from Milo who received the money, sor
nobody will say that the affair took place in the presence
of witnesses. If this learned critic knew more of what
goes cn in the world, he would not believe that a man of
rank could be well flogged by an injured husband without
the story being known, even if both the adulterer and
the husband and wife said nothing about it. How does
he suppose that Sallust could get out of Milo’s house, or
out of any house after such treatment without all the
slaves knowing it, and others too? As to the confirma·
tion of Varro's story from Horace and his Scholiast's
note, it is not of much value, perhaps it has no value at
all, but another passage in Horace shows that Fausta
was believed to be a loose woman, and that one Villius,
who was her lover, was alac caught and beaten by Milo,
but there was no money paid on that occasion.

vhe date of Sallust's unlucky adventure is not fixed,
but we must infer that it was before Milo killed Clodius
in January, uo. 52. Sallust, as it hasbeen already said,
showed his hostility to Milo on this occasion, but there
is no evidence of his being reconciled to Milo before
Milo’s trial, as Kritz affirms that Asconius says. Asco-
nius only says that Sallust was suspected of having come
to terms with Milo; a mere popular rumour, which how·
ever as being merely a rumour, Ι suppose, that a learned

man ought to believe, as Varro believed another popular
