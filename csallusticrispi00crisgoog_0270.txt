tunsurus. 236

Sed quoniam humanarum rerum Fortuna pleraque regit,
cui scilicet placuisse et vim et gratiam nostram te expe·
riri, nunc, quando perillam licet, festina atque uti coe·
pisti perge. Multa atque opportuna habes, quo facilius
errata officiis superes. Postremo hoc in pectus tuum
demitte numquam populum Romanum beneficiis rictum
esse; namsbello quid valeat tuto scis.” Ad ea Bocchus·
placide et benigne; simul pauca pro delicto suo rerba
l'acit: “aa non hostili animo sed ob regnum tutandum
arma cepisse, nam Numidiae partem, unde vi J ugurtham
expulerit, jure belli suam factam} eam vastari aMario
pati nequivisse3 praeterea missis antea Romam legatis
repulsum ab amicitia: ceterum vetera omittere, ac tum,
si per Marium liceret, legatos ad senatum missurum.”
Dein copia facta animus barbari ab amicis flexus, quos
J ugurtha cognita legatione Sullae et Manli, metuens id
quod parabatur, donis corruperat.
